# ECSE-324-F2021
These three labs have been completed for the course Computer Organization, are written in ARM assembly and were executed on an [Altera DE1-SoC simulator](http://ecse324.ece.mcgill.ca/simulator/?sys=arm-de1soc).
### Lab 1
Write an iterative Fibonacci function, a recursive Fibonacci function, a 2D convolution algorithm and a bubble sort algorithm.
### Lab 2
Write drivers for hardware aboard the DE1-SoC, including slider switches, LEDs, hexadecimal displays, pushbuttons. Use these drivers to implement a counter, a polling-based stopwatch and an interrupt-based stopwatch.
### Lab 3
Write drivers for the VGA output, PS/2 input and use them to implement a tic-tac-toe game.
